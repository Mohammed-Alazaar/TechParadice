## 1. Project Overview

**DragLab Germany** is a full-featured, production-grade B2B web platform built for a laboratory equipment manufacturer. The platform serves as the company's global digital presence — combining a multilingual product catalog, a lead management pipeline, a rich content publishing system, and a comprehensive admin panel for non-technical staff.

The platform is built with **server-side rendering** (Node.js + EJS), backed by **MongoDB Atlas**, and deployed with a strong focus on security, SEO, and performance across 5 languages: English, German, Spanish, Turkish, and French.

## 3. Architecture Overview

The platform follows a classic **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern:

```
routes/        → Define URL paths and HTTP methods
controllers/   → Handle business logic (shop.js, admin.js)
models/        → Mongoose schemas (18 models)
Front-end/     → EJS views, CSS, client JS
middleware/    → Auth, CSRF, multer, error handling
```

**Request flow:**
1. Browser request hits Express router
2. Middleware runs (session check, CSRF, nonce generation)
3. Controller queries MongoDB and processes data
4. EJS template rendered with injected data
5. Compressed HTML response sent to browser

**Caching layers:**
- Navigation products: in-memory cache with 10-minute TTL
- User session data: in-memory cache with 60-second TTL
- Static assets: browser cache 7 days (CSS/JS), 365 days (versioned assets)
- MongoDB: connection pool (max 20 concurrent connections)

---

## 4. User Roles & Authentication

### Roles

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| **Public** | Any visitor — no login required |
| **subAdmin** | Staff member — can manage products, content, and forms |
| **admin** | Full access — includes user management and system settings |

### Authentication Flow

- Login via email + password (bcryptjs hash comparison)
- Session stored in MongoDB (7-day expiry)
- User data cached in memory (60-second TTL) to reduce DB queries
- Password reset via secure token (`resetToken` + `resetTokenExpiration` fields)
- All protected routes use an `isAuth` middleware that checks session and role

### Account Management (Admin only)
- Create new admin/subAdmin accounts
- Edit name, email, phone number, role
- Delete accounts
- Force password reset for any user

---

## 5. Multilingual System

The entire platform supports **5 languages**: English (EN), German (DE), Spanish (ES), Turkish (TR), French (FR).

### How it works

- All content fields are duplicated per language inside the MongoDB document (e.g., `Language.EN`, `Language.DE`, etc.)
- Each language version has its own **publish status**: a product can be published in EN and DE but still be a draft in ES
- Routes include the language code as a URL prefix: `/en/products/`, `/de/products/`, `/tr/products/`
- Browser `Accept-Language` header is detected on first visit and used for auto-redirect
- Navigation product list is preloaded and cached per language separately

### Per-language fields (across models)
- Product name, description, features, technical specifications, downloads
- Model name, description, overview sections, applications
- Article title, slug, body, summary, tags
- Case study title, client profile, problem, solution, results
- FAQ question and answer
- Glossary term, definition, description
- Testimonial customer quote
- Accessory description
- Slideshow title, description, button label and link
- Industry page hero content, intro section, features list

### SEO per language
- Each product and model has its own `meta.title` and `meta.description` per language
- Localized `tags` (keyword arrays) per language used in weighted text search indexes
- `hreflang` link tags generated in `<head>` for all language variants of each page
- Canonical URL set to the current language version

## 11. Security

### Transport Security
- **HTTPS enforced** on all production routes
- **HSTS** (HTTP Strict Transport Security) with a 2-year max-age and preload flag
- **Strict-Transport-Security** header set by Helmet

### Content Security Policy
- Nonce-based CSP generated dynamically per request
- Allows only trusted script and style sources
- Blocks inline scripts without a valid nonce
- Prevents XSS by rejecting unauthorized script execution

### Headers (via Helmet)
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` — prevents clickjacking
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` — prevents MIME-type sniffing
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Permissions-Policy` — restricts camera, microphone, geolocation API access

### Form Security
- **CSRF tokens** on every form (csurf middleware)
- **Google reCAPTCHA Enterprise** on all public forms to block bots
- **express-validator** for server-side input validation and sanitization
- **File upload restrictions**: allowed MIME types enforced by Multer, 10MB size limit

### Authentication Security
- Passwords hashed with **bcryptjs** (salt rounds configured per environment)
- Session tokens stored in MongoDB with 7-day expiry
- Password reset via time-limited tokens (resetToken + resetTokenExpiration)
- No plaintext credentials stored anywhere

### Spam Prevention
- IP address recorded on every form submission
- Geolocation (country, ISP) tracked via geoip-lite
- User agent and referrer logging
- `isSpam` flag on Quote, Contact, DistributorApplication, TechnicalService, WarrantyRegistration
- Admin can mark submissions as spam without deleting them

### Legacy URL Handling
- 301 permanent redirects for old `.php` and `.shtml` URLs
- 410 Gone responses for permanently removed paths
- Base64 garbage URL detection and rejection

## 12. Performance & Caching

### Server-Side Caching
| Cache | TTL | What is cached |
|---|---|---|
| Navigation products | 10 minutes | Products displayed in the site navigation, per language |
| User session data | 60 seconds | Logged-in user object to reduce DB reads |

### Static Asset Caching
- CSS and JS files: `Cache-Control: max-age=604800` (7 days)
- Versioned assets (hashed filenames): `Cache-Control: max-age=31536000` (365 days)
- ETag support for conditional requests (`304 Not Modified`)

### Network Compression
- `compression` middleware with gzip enabled for all text responses
- 1 KB minimum threshold before compression is applied

### Image Optimization
- All images served from **Cloudinary CDN**
- **Sharp** used for server-side resizing before upload
- Lazy loading implemented on article and product listing pages
- Responsive image variants delivered via Cloudinary URL transformations

### Database Performance
- MongoDB connection pool: max 20 concurrent connections
- Compound indexes on frequently queried field combinations:
  - `{ isDraft: 1, slug: 1 }` for product page lookups
  - Per-language publish status indexes
  - Accessory: applicable product slug, model ID indexes
- Weighted text search index covers all 5 languages simultaneously

### Request Logging
- Morgan logger skips static asset requests (CSS, JS, images) to reduce noise
- Access log written to `access.log` file

## 13. SEO System

### URL Structure
- Language-prefixed clean URLs: `/en/products/water-bath-series/wb-12-digital`
- Slugs auto-generated from content names via Slugify
- Legacy URL redirects (301) maintain link equity from old site structure

### Meta Tags
- Unique `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` per page per language
- Admin can set custom SEO title and description for every product and model in all 5 languages
- Fallback to product/model name if custom meta is not set

### Multilingual SEO
- `<link rel="hreflang">` tags generated in `<head>` for all 5 language variants of every page
- `<link rel="canonical">` pointing to the current language version

### Structured Data (JSON-LD)
- Organization schema on company pages
- FAQPage schema on FAQ pages
- Product schema on model detail pages

### XML Sitemap
- Auto-generated sitemap covering all published content
- Includes all language variants of every URL
- Updated dynamically as content is published

### RSS / Atom Feeds
- Article syndication via `/feed/rss` and `/feed/atom`
- Helps search engines discover new content faster

### Search (Internal)
- MongoDB full-text search with weighted fields:
  - Product/model name: weight 10
  - Tags/keywords: weight 8
  - Descriptions: weight 5
- Search covers all 5 languages simultaneously in a single query
- Client-side fuzzy search powered by Fuse.js

### Analytics
- Google Analytics
- Google Ads conversion tracking
- Bing Ads tracking
- Microsoft Clarity (session recording, heatmaps) — ENV-gated

## 14. Email System

### Architecture
The platform uses a **dual-delivery architecture**:

| Channel | Provider | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Customer emails | SendGrid | Order confirmations, form acknowledgements, marketing |
| Internal alerts | Nodemailer + SMTP | Notifications to company staff when a form is submitted |

### SendGrid Templates
- Dynamic templates with placeholder variables
- Separate template IDs per form type (quote, distributor, warranty, etc.)
- Triggered automatically on successful form submission

### Internal SMTP Alerts
- Sent via Nodemailer on every form submission
- Includes all submitted data formatted as plain text or HTML
- Fallback-capable (if SendGrid fails, SMTP alert still fires)

### Developer Utilities
- `mail-dry-run.log` — logs email content without sending during development
- Sandbox mode support for testing without delivering real emails

---

## 15. File Management & Media

### Image Uploads
- All images uploaded to **Cloudinary** via the admin panel
- **Sharp** resizes and compresses images server-side before upload
- Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP

### Document Uploads
- Distributor applications can upload a company profile document
- Stored on Cloudinary with a secure URL
- Quote forms accept file attachments up to 10MB

### File Handling (Multer)
- Multipart form processing for all file upload endpoints
- MIME type validation (only allowed types accepted)
- File size limits enforced at middleware level
- Filename sanitization to prevent path traversal attacks

### PDF Generation
- **pdf-lib**: Fill styled PDF templates (e.g., quote documents with company branding)
- **pdfkit**: Programmatic generation with tables, borders, footers, and styled text
- PDFs generated on demand in the admin panel and downloadable immediately

### Excel Export
- **ExcelJS** generates `.xlsx` files for newsletter subscriber exports
